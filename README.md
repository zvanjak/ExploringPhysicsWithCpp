## Introduction

This repository is a website for my forthcoming book "Exploring Physics with C++" (now in version 0.5).

In folder Book you will find latest PDF (draft) version of the book.

In the folder Code you will find the source code for the programs in the book.

## Installation

To try out the programs, simply clone the repository to your local machine by the method of your choosing, and open folder Code with Visual Studio Code (or Visual Studio on Windows).
